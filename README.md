Simple stopwatch for recording my projects, written in Ionic

Windows 10 has a good one in the app store that's free, but I want something cross-platform that I don't need an internet connection for, and can start as an App. There are many tutorials out there but I just want my own

Premises:
Simple. Push Button on and Off.
I like the Upwork App, should be similar. (no screenshots)
Completely on my Desktop, no need for online connection or logging in.
Cross-Platform
Make notes maybe and subject? Might think of that feature later.

This is just a draft. I will let people know if they can upload it.
